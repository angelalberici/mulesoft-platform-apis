# MuleSoft Platform APIs

Every time you login into the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, you are implicitly calling a set of APIs that are invoked by the UI, which are the PlatformAPIs! You can make these HTTP requests directly as well.

If you are new to Platform APIs please go through this [post!](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/howto/get-started-with-platform-apis-and-postman-automation/)

## Prerequisites
Before we start working with platform APIs, you need these three pieces of data: a session token, the organization id and the environment id; as shown in the below image.

<p>Make sure you have <a href="https://www.postman.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Postman</a> installed, that you do know how to <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collection-runs/working-with-data-files/#importing-sample-collection-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">import the Postman Collection and the Environment</a> and then you can finally download the postman assets from this repository. Import both files and make sure to add both anypoint-username and anypoint-password to your Postman Environment, the fields highlighted below.</p>

## Start using

That's about it. Download import into your Postman, add your credentials to the Environment. Ideas? Comments around the Anypoint Platform APIs documentation? Please leave them in the [post!](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/howto/get-started-with-platform-apis-and-postman-automation/)
